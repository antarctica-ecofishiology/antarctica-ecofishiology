## Antarctic Expedition: B-207-M

***

## Welcome to the B-207-M expedition website!

We are excited to welcome you to our expedition website. Here we will blog about life at McMurdo Station, the research we are conducting and post photos of the frozen landscape and fascinating animals we encounter.

## Delayed - updated
#### *10.2.2018 - Ken Zillig*  

Good news / bad news today for the deployment. Good news; we were prioritized to be on the second flight down to the ice of the summer season. Bad news; there is persistent rough weather down at McMurdo. The station has its own [weather classification system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica_Weather_Danger_Classification), and for a couple hours this week it has been at “Condition 1” which includes one, if not more of the following:  

* Visibility less than 30 feet
* Wind speed over 63 mph
* Air temp or wind-chill below -100°F

Needless to say, they won’t be landing a plane in such conditions and as such we’ll have to wait until conditions improve. Currently we are scheduled to fly out on Oct. ~~3rd~~, ~~4th~~ ~~5th~~ ~~6th~~ 7-10th. 

But the day was not wasted! Today we received our ECW (extreme cold weather) gear. This gear is provided to us by the Antarctic program and is mandatory to be carried alongside you whenever you leave McMurdo Station to head into the field. Some notable pieces are “big red” the large down parka, and the “bunny boots” which have a valved air bladder to insulate you from the ground. The table below gives the full list of ECW gear as well as some pictures.

Today we also received some preliminary training on operating vehicles, waste disposal and fire safety. Along with a flu shot, given enmass by lining us all up and one-by-one injecting us with a vaccine dose. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
# Add this list once i get stuff from USAP in Cristchurch
ECW.table <- data.frame("Item" = "Big Red" , "Number" = 1 )
ECW.table$Item <- as.character(ECW.table$Item)
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Bunny Boots", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Windpants", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Fleece Jacket", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Fleece Pants", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Hat", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Neck Gaiter", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Balaclava", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Gloves", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Mittens", 1))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Glove Liners", 2))
ECW.table <- rbind(ECW.table, list("Goggles", 1))

## What is Our Research?
####  *9.29.18 ~ Ken Zillig*
The climate is changing. Anthropogenic uses of fossil fuels have produced carbon emissions that have increased the insulating capacity of the atmosphere. In essence wrapping the planet in a sweater that traps heat near the surface. These changes are having large influences around the globe and are making themselves more and more apparent, such as warmer winters, hotter summers, stronger fires and irregular weather patterns. However, less apparent is the effect that CO~2~ is having on the oceans.  
<br>
In the ocean, CO~2~ has two effects. One is the increasing of ocean surface temperatures similar to increasing surface temperatures elsewhere (AKA climate change). The other effect is more difficult to observe. CO~2~ is dissolving into the oceans and turning the ocean more acidic (AKA ocean acidification). This change is slight but can have profound impacts on sea life.  
<br>
The foundation of the oceans food web is made of tiny, microscopic organisms that make protective shells and armor from calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is similar to baking soda and like baking soda, it reacts with acid. Think of the vinegar and baking soda volcanos common at science fairs. While not as visually dramatic as the kitchen counter volcano, increasing ocean acidity makes it much more difficult for the tiny microorganisms of the ocean to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. This in turn reduces the amount of food produced at the bottom of the ocean food-web. Ocean acidification and rising temperatures has many other effects throughout the ocean. From challenging coral reefs (made of calcium carbonate and sensitive to temperature) to disrupting the brain chemistry of fish. Our research is seeking to explore how these two facets of carbon pollution will influence the physiology and ecology of Antarctic fishes.  
<br>
The fish of the Antarctic (our focal species) live in one of the most extreme and inhospitable places on earth. However, despite these challenges the day to day, year to year existence of these organisms is incredibly stable. The water is very cold, but the temperature hardly ever changes. The surface is routinely covered in a thick sheet of ice, and as such the bottom has remained isolated. The extended environmental stability has allowed Antarctic organisms to become habitat specialists, trading traits applicable to variable environments for those the promote living in Antarctica and nowhere else. Climate change and ocean acidification are expected to disrupt the environmental stability and the effects may be most pronounced in organisms with very specialized biology. Our research is to understand how these organisms may adapt or respond so that we may anticipate the biological and ecological changes that are coming to Antarctica.  
<br>
We are conducting several experiments, but they all stem from a few core treatments that we will be applying to Antarctic fish brought to the lab. Simply put we will expose fish to simulated environmental conditions representing present and future climate conditions. Fish will be exposed to two temperatures and three CO~2~ levels. Fish will be captured from the wild and placed within tanks with each tank having a different combination of temperature and CO~2~ treatments. Once exposed we will begin tracking how the behavior and physiology of fish exposed to different treatment changes over time.  
<br>
We hope that our research will help inform our scientific understanding of how increasing CO~2~ will affect Antarctic fish, as well as fish more generally. Our work is just a piece in a greater understanding of how CO~2~ pollution will impact ocean biology with implications for the Antarctic, commercial fishing and conservation.

## Travelling to Antarctica
#### *9.15.2018 - Ken Zillig*
As you may expect, getting to Antarctica is a multiple day event. Our team will leave from San Francisco, CA on September 29th 2018 on route to Christchurch, by way of Auckland New Zealand. Once in Christchurch, we will have a day or two in which to receive our extreme cold weather gear (ECW) as well as any outstanding vaccinations and preliminary training. Christchurch is one of a few cities in the world that routes to Antarctica and is the specific point of entry for people traveling to McMurdo on the Ross Sea. Currently we are scheduled to leave for Antarctica on the second flight of the season (approx. Oct 3rd)
<br>
The trip down to McMurdo is weather dependent, and will only depart if we can land safely. Should a storm develop while we are in the air the plane is equipped to conduct a “boomerang” where it will turn around without landing and fly us back to Christchurch. All of this is done aboard an U.S. C-17 or LC-130 Cargo Plane.
