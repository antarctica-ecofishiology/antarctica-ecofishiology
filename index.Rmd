***

## Welcome to the B-207-M expedition website!

> We are exicted to welcome you to our expedition website. Here we will blog about life at McMurdo, the research we are conducting and post photos of the frozen landscape and fascinating animals we encounter. 

> Our expedtion is to McMurdo station on the Ross Sea. Here we will be collecting species of *Notothenioid* fishes and testing their physiological and behavioral response under current and predicted climate conditions. Our focus is on the early life-stages of these antarctic fish species and how climate change will affect their development from embryos to juveniles.
