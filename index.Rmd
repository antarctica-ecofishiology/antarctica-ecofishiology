## Antarctic Expedition: B-207-M

***

## Welcome to the B-207-M expedition website!

> We are exicted to welcome you to our expedition website. Here we will blog about life at McMurdo, the research we are conducting and post photos of the frozen landscape and fascinating animals we encounter. 

> Our expedtion is to McMurdo station on the Ross Sea. Here we will be collecting species of *Notothenioid* fishes and testing their physiological and behavioral response under current and predicted climate conditions. Our focus is on the early life-stages of these antarctic fish species and how climate change will affect their development from embryos to juveniles.

## Travelling to Antarctica - 9.15.2018
> As you may expect, getting to Antarctica is a multiple day event. Our team will leave from San Francisco, CA on September 29th 2018 on route to Christchurch, by way of Auckland New Zealand. Once in Christchurch, we will have a day or two in which to receive our extreme cold weather gear (ECW) as well as any outstanding vaccinations and preliminary training. Christchurch is one of a few cities in the world that routes to Antarctica and is the specific point of entry for people traveling to McMurdo on the Ross Sea. Currently we are scheduled to leave for Antarctica on the second flight of the season (approx. Oct 3rd)

>The trip down to McMurdo is weather dependent, and will only depart if we can land safely. Should a storm develop while we are in the air the plane is equipped to conduct a “boomerang” where it will turn around without landing and fly us back to Christchurch. All of this is done aboard an U.S. C-17 or LC-130 Cargo Plane.
