# Antarctic Organisms

## **Our Study Species**
### *Trematomus bernacchii* ~ The Emerald Rock Cod

<br>

This is our primary species of interest. This photograph is of an adult, while our research will primarily focus on larval and juvenile life stages. *T. bernachii* (or as well affectionately call them "bernies") is one of the dominant fish species in this region and is an important part of the food-web both as a predator of other fish (include it's own species) as well as a food item for seals and the Antarctic toothfish *Dissostichus mawsoni*.

### *Trematomus pennellii* Sharp-spined notothen Trematomus

<br>

Another of the species we will be encountering. We hope to conduct research identifying the preferred temperature or temperatures of multiple antarctic fish species so that we may compare amongst species and look for differences. *T. pennellii* is a very close relative to *T. bernachii* and therefore any differences in thermal preference may underscore important differences in how these two species interact with their environment.

## **Mammals**

## **Other Creatures from Under the Ice**

The Diver's went out the other day and brought back things for the touch tank and a photoshoot. Here are some of the jems.

Everyone love's an octopus. This one has been named Oscar by the Crary Lab Staff. It is being housed in a seperate enclosed tank as Octopus are known escape artists that will crawl out of their tanks or down drain pipes.
